# Python-Class-1  
*Aarish Codes’ First Python Class Project*

Welcome to this repository — your stepping-stone into the world of Python and object-oriented programming. This project captures the journey and exercises from **Python Class-1** taught by Aarish.

## 🎯 Project Overview  
- **Course:** First Python class (Class-1)  
- **Instructor / Author:** Aarish (aka `aarishcodes`)  
- **Purpose:** To build foundational knowledge in Python — covering basics, data handling, classes, simple file operations, etc.  
- **Repository Contents:**  
  - `index.py`, `employee.py` — core Python scripts demonstrating class creation and usage.  
  - `employees_db.dat`, `employees_db.json`, `employees_db.sqlite` — various formats of an example employee database.  
  - `*.txt` data files (`minmax_data.txt`, `names_data.txt`, `sentence_data.txt`, `qn01_data.txt`) — sample data files for practice and I/O exercises.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find  
- **OOP in action:** The `employee.py` script shows how to define a class, instantiate objects, and perform operations (CRUD) on them.  
- **Data formats & persistence:** Multiple representations of the same employee data — raw dat file, JSON, SQLite — giving a hands-on comparison of storage types.  
- **File I/O & data processing:** The text files are used for reading, parsing, and data manipulation exercises (min/max, name lists, sentence processing).  
- **Indexing & workflow:** `index.py` serves as a driver or main script to tie together data, classes and operations.
